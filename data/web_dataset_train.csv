"Welcome to Sykes For over 100 years, Sykes has proudly served the Flathead Valley through the Diner, the Market, and other amenities. Our restaurant provides a casual and friendly dining experience with excellent food and generous portions at great prices combined with a local flavor that is rare. Recent renovations have added a new chapter to the story of Sykes. Doug and Judy Wise had owned the business for over 60 years when in the Fall of 2010, they decided to sell the business to local businessman Ray Thompson. After a team was installed to carry on the friendliness that we are known for and significant remodeling and additions, the market opened in the Fall of 2011 and the apartments in the Summer of 2012. Here at Sykes, we are committed to preserving the principles and services that Sykes was founded on: Honesty, Friendliness, and Great Value. We look forward to you stopping in!

"MENU SHOP More... If you have ever worked in the service industry, you know that it is hard work in the best of times. During a global pandemic, it is even more stressful. From dealing with social distancing guidelines to increased foot traffic inside the restaurants to wearing a face mask for your whole shift in the middle of summer, and it can be exhausting both mentally and physically. So, throughout September, we are going to close each restaurant one day per week so that each employee can have at least two days off per week. We hope you understand, we would rather trade that one day’s business in order to help our employee’s mental and physical health.

"360-734-1071 Select Page Our Story A Love for All Things Food. In 2002, Azizi Tookas and Chris Sunde began with the idea to incorporate cuisine and local farming into one. Brandywine Kitchen is the culmination of their passion for food and sustainable agriculture. Brandywine first began as an heirloom tomato farm and has grown its niche to include a diversity of produce. In 2008 Brandywine Gardens expanded into the prepared food business as Brandywine Kitchen. The result of this process is that Brandywine Kitchen can offer sustainable food that is locally based, delicious, and affordable. From seed to plate… Our Food From seed to plate. From seed to plate is a motto that encompasses both our history as food producers and our belief that understanding and supporting local food systems, leads to a superior product. In addition to growing a small amount of heirloom tomatoes for the restaurant, we source local produce and other local products, allowing us to use the freshest ingredients possible, make personal relationships with local producers, and keep money circulating within the Bellingham community.

"Select Page AUTHENTIC MEXICAN CUISINE Midtown Hoboken “El Charro” – Weehawken Our History In the early eighties, Filiberto and Genoveva Arias came to America with a dream. Arriving from Putla, Oaxaca, Filiberto obtained a position in a local restaurant and Genoveva worked as a seamstress in a nearby factory. To make ends meet, Filiberto would cook “crispies” and sell them to the factory workers at lunchtime. From these humble beginnings, Charrito’s Restaurant was established on July 19, 1992, in Union City, New Jersey, offering a cuisine that is primarily inspired by many traditional favorites from Oaxaca. Charrito’s also offers a wide variety of rich plates native to Mexico’s adjoining 31 States. Although, its menu and its appearance has often changed in the past decade, the quality of Charrito’s cuisine and our dedication to providing an authentic Mexican dining experience remains the same. 2020 © Charrito's",,,,restaurant

"Vegan | Vegetarian | Chinese Style Dishes Open Daily 11am-3pm and 4:30pm-9:30pm Dear Customers, My name is Veggie Lee, the owner of this restaurant. I have worked in kitchens for over 31 years, and have held positions as main and executive chef. I’ve spent the last 10 years running my own seafood restaurant. I love to cook, and did so frequently. However, I noticed that I was gaining weight and living an unhealthy lifestyle. I began to research vegetarianism and learned about the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. I tried it for myself and adopted the vegetarian lifestyle. After a few months, I lost over 30 pounds and lowered my cholesterol levels. My family and I have been practicing this lifestyle and we’ve enjoyed the health benefits that it provides. The purpose of this restaurant is not only to provide our customers with delicious meals made with the finest ingredients, but also to provide them with healthy meals. Thank you. Sincerely,",,,,restaurant
