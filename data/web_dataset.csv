"Select Page AUTHENTIC MEXICAN CUISINE Midtown Hoboken “El Charro” – Weehawken Our History In the early eighties, Filiberto and Genoveva Arias came to America with a dream. Arriving from Putla, Oaxaca, Filiberto obtained a position in a local restaurant and Genoveva worked as a seamstress in a nearby factory. To make ends meet, Filiberto would cook “crispies” and sell them to the factory workers at lunchtime. From these humble beginnings, Charrito’s Restaurant was established on July 19, 1992, in Union City, New Jersey, offering a cuisine that is primarily inspired by many traditional favorites from Oaxaca. Charrito’s also offers a wide variety of rich plates native to Mexico’s adjoining 31 States. Although, its menu and its appearance has often changed in the past decade, the quality of Charrito’s cuisine and our dedication to providing an authentic Mexican dining experience remains the same. 2020 © Charrito's",,,,restaurant

"Sols Sandwich Shop & Deli is all about fresh and local. All of our burgers, hoagies, wraps and sandwiches are made to order with great ingredients and generous portions. Located in downtown Birmingham, just off 20th Street North, youve just got to stop by and try some of our delicious meals to believe what people are saying about Sols! Sol Bajalieh arrived in the United States in 1965. His love of 2 things: people and food inspired him to open Sols Sandwich Shop & Deli in 1968 in downtown Birmingham at the original John Hand building. Sol provided the downtown scene with delicious meals until the building was condemned in 1995. Fast forward 13 years later, and Sols three sons: Jeff, Chris, and Jason have revived a great Birmingham tradition to honor their late Father.

"Welcome to Sykes For over 100 years, Sykes has proudly served the Flathead Valley through the Diner, the Market, and other amenities. Our restaurant provides a casual and friendly dining experience with excellent food and generous portions at great prices combined with a local flavor that is rare. Recent renovations have added a new chapter to the story of Sykes. Doug and Judy Wise had owned the business for over 60 years when in the Fall of 2010, they decided to sell the business to local businessman Ray Thompson. After a team was installed to carry on the friendliness that we are known for and significant remodeling and additions, the market opened in the Fall of 2011 and the apartments in the Summer of 2012. Here at Sykes, we are committed to preserving the principles and services that Sykes was founded on: Honesty, Friendliness, and Great Value. We look forward to you stopping in!

"Vegan | Vegetarian | Chinese Style Dishes Open Daily 11am-3pm and 4:30pm-9:30pm Dear Customers, My name is Veggie Lee, the owner of this restaurant. I have worked in kitchens for over 31 years, and have held positions as main and executive chef. I’ve spent the last 10 years running my own seafood restaurant. I love to cook, and did so frequently. However, I noticed that I was gaining weight and living an unhealthy lifestyle. I began to research vegetarianism and learned about the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. I tried it for myself and adopted the vegetarian lifestyle. After a few months, I lost over 30 pounds and lowered my cholesterol levels. My family and I have been practicing this lifestyle and we’ve enjoyed the health benefits that it provides. The purpose of this restaurant is not only to provide our customers with delicious meals made with the finest ingredients, but also to provide them with healthy meals. Thank you. Sincerely,",,,,restaurant

"360-734-1071 Select Page Our Story A Love for All Things Food. In 2002, Azizi Tookas and Chris Sunde began with the idea to incorporate cuisine and local farming into one. Brandywine Kitchen is the culmination of their passion for food and sustainable agriculture. Brandywine first began as an heirloom tomato farm and has grown its niche to include a diversity of produce. In 2008 Brandywine Gardens expanded into the prepared food business as Brandywine Kitchen. The result of this process is that Brandywine Kitchen can offer sustainable food that is locally based, delicious, and affordable. From seed to plate… Our Food From seed to plate. From seed to plate is a motto that encompasses both our history as food producers and our belief that understanding and supporting local food systems, leads to a superior product. In addition to growing a small amount of heirloom tomatoes for the restaurant, we source local produce and other local products, allowing us to use the freshest ingredients possible, make personal relationships with local producers, and keep money circulating within the Bellingham community.
